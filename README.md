# BitcoinZ Installation Script

Welcome to the BitcoinZ installation script! This script is designed to help you quickly and easily set up a BitcoinZ node on your Linux system. By following just a few steps, you can run a fully functional node, contribute to the BitcoinZ network, and enjoy the benefits of decentralized, community-driven cryptocurrency.

## About BitcoinZ

BitcoinZ is a decentralized, open-source cryptocurrency that embodies the true spirit of blockchain technology: no central authority, no pre-mined coins, and strong support from a passionate global community. It seeks to retain the original Bitcoin principles of financial freedom, security, and privacy while introducing features like improved scalability, faster transactions, and resistance to ASIC mining. With BitcoinZ, you’re part of a movement that values transparency, fairness, and innovation.

## Features of This Script

- **Automated Setup:** Handles dependency checks, downloads the BitcoinZ daemon, and configures it, all with minimal user input.
- **Secure Configuration:** Generates random RPC credentials, ensuring that your node is more secure right from the start.
- **Systemd Integration:** Installs a systemd service to manage your BitcoinZ node, enabling easy start, stop, and automatic reboot on system restarts.
- **Optional Bootstrap:** Offers the option to download and apply a bootstrap file for faster initial synchronization of the blockchain, saving you time and bandwidth.
- **Progress Indicators:** Displays download progress and steps as they happen, giving you a user-friendly installation experience.

## Requirements

- A Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux system
- Root access (`sudo`)
- Systemd for service management

This script will automatically attempt to install any missing dependencies, including:
- `wget` (for downloading)
- `openssl` (for generating credentials)
- `coreutils` (for `sha256sum` verification)
- `p7zip-full` (for extracting the bootstrap archive)
- `tar` (for extracting the daemon)

## Installation Steps

1. **Download the Script:**
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simbav911/bitcoinz-installer/main/install_bitcoinz.sh
   ```

2. **Make it Executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_bitcoinz.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Installer:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./install_bitcoinz.sh
   ```

   The script will guide you through the process. You will be prompted to optionally download and apply the blockchain bootstrap. If you choose "y", the script will automatically download, verify checksums, and extract the bootstrap files, accelerating your initial sync.

## After Installation

- **Check Node Status:**
  ```bash
  systemctl status bitcoinz
  ```
- **Stop the Node:**
  ```bash
  systemctl stop bitcoinz
  ```
- **View Logs:**
  ```bash
  journalctl -u bitcoinz -n 50

  - **Start the node:**
  ```bash
  systemctl start bitcoinz
  ```
  
  
- The configuration files and blockchain data reside in:
  ```bash
  /root/.bitcoinz/
  ```
  Here, you’ll find `bitcoinz.conf` and `debug.log` among other files.

**Note:** Your randomly generated RPC credentials will be displayed at the end of the installation. Please keep them safe if you plan on using RPC calls.
